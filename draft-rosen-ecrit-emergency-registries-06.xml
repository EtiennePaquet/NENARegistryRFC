    <abstract>
      <t>Multiple emergency services standards organizations are developing standards based on IETF emergency call standards and other IETF protocols.  There is a desire among these organizations to use common registries not tied to a particular country or national SDO, in the long term pursuit of a single worldwide standard. This document asks IANA to create a set of registries and provides processes for expanding the set and populating them.</t>

        establishes a framework for carrying emergency calls over the Internet using the SIP (

        <xref target="RFC3261" />
        ) protocol.  Various regional organizations are developing standards for how calls conforming to this framework are handled within the Emergency Services IP Networks (ESInets) established by local, regional or national authorities to handle such calls and deliver them to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).  Many of these standards have needed registries of values used in the protocols and services the services define.  Prior to this document, such registries were managed by the regional SDOs themselves.  There is a desire among many of the regional emergency services SDOs to have a single world-wide standard for handling emergency calls and as part of that effort, a single set of registries managed by a neutral party.  This document requests IANA to establish a new registry area called "Emergency" and to create a set of registries within that area.  This document does not describe initial contents of the registries.  That will be accomplished by requests from the regional SDOs, including <xref target="NENAi3" format="default">The NENA i3 Standard</xref>.

        <name>"urn:emergency:service" URN Subregistry</name>
        <t>
          This document creates a subregistry for "urn:emergency:service" under urn:emergecy.
        </t>
        <t>
          When calls are routed within an ESInet, the routing element (PSAP or ESRP) queries the ECRF for the (nominal) route. It does so with a service URN. Esternal routing is accomplished with "urn:service:sos", as defined by RFC 5031. Within an ESInet, values under this registry are used.
        </t>
        <t>
          Service URNs as defined here begin with “urn:emergency:service”. The sub-namespace defined by this registry MAY be further subdivided (potentially several times), by sub-registries under this sub-registry. A new entry starting with “urn:emergency:service” SHOULD denote a new type of route, which MUST be distinguished by the PSAP or ESRP from other uses. For example, 9-1-1 calls being routed within the ESInet use “urn:emergency:service:sos” (or a subspace of it). Calls routed by a PSAP to a responder use “urn:emergency:service:responder” (the type of responder is also included, e.g.,  “urn:emergency:service:responder.police”). A PSAP or ESRP specifies the URN in a LoST query, and the ECRF uses it to choose a (nominal) route. In this entry in the “urn:emergency” registry, “service” means a path towards a service, as it does for “urn:service” as defined by RFC 5031.

        <t>
          Routing of emergency calls within the ESInet is a primary function of prevailing standards for NG9-1-1, including <xref target="NENAi3" format="default">The NENA i3 Standard</xref>. When ESRPs must route calls within the ESInet, they query the ECRF for the route. Routing for emergency calls may involve multiple levels of ESRPs. Each level may need a different URN to be distinguishable (it is also possible for the ECRF to distinguish by the identity of the ESRP that queries it). Routing of emergency calls, including instant messages and non-interactive calls, is accomplished with a URN beginning with “urn:emergency:service:sos”.
        </t>
        <t>
          The “urn:emergency:service:sos” registry contains label values appropriate for the various levels of routing within the ESInet.

        </t>
        <t>
          Test calls are directed to “urn:service:test.sos”. To route such test calls where the routing infrastructure uses multiple levels of routing, and thus uses URNs in the “urn:emergency:service:sos” registry, service URNs are needed for test calls with similar levels. IANA is requested to create an entry in the “urn:emergency:service” registry with the name “test” and with the purpose noted as “routing test calls within the ESInet toward a primary PSAP”. The reference will be to the registry created by this section, “urn:emergency:service:test”. The separator between the “test” label and the service (“urn:emergency:service:test” registry name) is a period “.”. The “urn:emergency:service:test” registry contains label values corresponding to the levels in the “urn:emergency:service:sos” registry. These registries are normally kept in sync, an entry added to “urn:emergency:service:sos” should also add a corresponding entry to urn:emergency:service:test.

        <t>
          Once a PSAP gets a call, they may have to transfer the call to a secondary PSAP. The secondary PSAP is chosen based on the type of responder, and the location of the caller. Routing of emergency calls from a PSAP towards a responder is accomplished with a URN beginning with “urn:emergency:service:responder”. IANA is requested to create an entry in the “urn:emergency:service” registry with the name “responder” and with the purpose noted as “routing emergency calls within the ESInet towards a responder”. The reference will be to the registry created by this section, “urn:emergency:service:responder”.
        </t>
        <t>
          The “urn:emergency:service:responder” registry contains label values appropriate for the types of responders within the ESInet. The separator between the “responder” label and the type of responder (“urn:emergency:service:responder” registry name) is a period “.”. This registry is also used in other contexts where an agency type is useful. For those purposes, a 'psap' entry is provided. “urn:emergency:service:agencyType.psap” must not be used to route emergency calls. It is not equivalent to, or a substitute for “urn:service:sos”.

        <t>
          Various entities need to create globally unique identifiers. A simple way to do that is to combine a locally unique identifier and a domain name (which is globally unique). However, many entities need to create more than one type of globally unique identifier and knowing what type of identifier is helpful in diagnosing problems. For this purpose, the uid URN subregistry creates unique strings used to prepend identifiers that indicate the type of identifier it is.

        <t>
          The NENA i3 standard includes various services which provide interfaces to access information or to engage in interactions in NG9-1-1, which are queried either using SIP or HTTP. These services are discoverable through the ESInet that has deployed an instance of these services according to the URI scheme of registries and subregistries created by the i3 standard and by this document. In order to faciliate interoperability there is need to codify their names in a registry. This document requests that IANA creates this registy. Other standards documents may create additional services, which will then be added to this registry.

        <name>"urn:emergency:service:serviceAgencyLocator" Subregistry</name>
        <t>
          The ESInet will connect to many services and public safety agencies. A directory (“white pages” and “yellow pages”) of agencies, together with key information about the service or agency, is the function of the Service/Agency Locator. The Service/Agency Locator is a distributed database. There are several mechanisms by which the Service/Agency Locator can be searched to locate a specific service or agency. One primary way to search the Service/Agency Locator is by name. The Service/Agency Locator provides a name (white page) search function, with wild cards, to find a specific service or agency. The search by name is more useful for agencies than services. The name that is searched comes from the “org” field of the Agency jCard that is returned in the Service/Agency Locator Record. Another method to search is by location and agency type.
